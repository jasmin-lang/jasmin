- Syntax for initializing variables at declaration time is less flexible: in
  any given declaration sequence, either no variable is initialized, and
  declarations may be separated by space or comma, or *all* variables are
  initialized and are separated by a mandatory comma.
  ([PR #1185](https://github.com/jasmin-lang/jasmin/pull/1185)).
