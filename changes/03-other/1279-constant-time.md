- The `jasmin-ct` tool now accepts `ct` annotation to describe the constant-time
  security type of functions. It also provides two new options `--print` and
  `--print-all`, use `jasmin-ct --help` for more information. The use of
  `#public`, `#secret` and `#poly` annotations in parameter and return type
  declarations has been deprecated.
