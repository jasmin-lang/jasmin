Detail instruction are available at
[link](https://github.com/jasmin-lang/jasmin/wiki/Installation-instructions)

## Dependencies

This formalization has been developed with the tools listed in the opam
file (located at the root of the project).

A convenient way to get the correct dependencies is to use the nix package
manager and to run in this directory:
```
nix-shell
```
This will enter in a shell environment in which all these dependencies are
available.

Alternatively, `opam` can be used. To set up `opam` detail instruction are
available at [link](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html). We require that a
valid `opam` switch is configured with a compiler version >= 4.12.0 and is set
as current switch.

First add the Coq repository to the current opam switch
```
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
```
then do
```
opam update
```
and install the dependencies listed in the opam file.


## Build

To run Coq and check the validity of the proofs, run in the `proof` directory:
```
make
```
This verifies all Coq files.

Alternatively, to compile the full compiler, run in the root of the project:
```
make
```
