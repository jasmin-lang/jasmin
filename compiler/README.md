The contents of the `src/CIL` directory are extracted from Coq files from several sources:

 -  the Coq standard library (LGPL 2.1 only, see [`src/CIL/LICENSE.coq`](src/CIL/LICENSE.coq))
 -  the Mathematical Components library (CÄ“CILL-B, see [`src/CIL/LICENSE.mathcomp`](src/CIL/LICENSE.mathcomp))
 -  the coqword library (MIT, see [`src/CIL/LICENSE.coqword`](src/CIL/LICENSE.coqword))
 -  the Jasmin coq source files (MIT, the [same license](LICENSE) as the rest of the compiler).

 The files `src/uint63.mli`, `src/uint63_31.ml`, and `src/uint63_63.ml` have
 been adapted from the source code of Coq and are distributed under the terms of
 the GNU Lesser General Public License Version 2.1 (see
